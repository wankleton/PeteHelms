              <p>
                I've spent my career building companies and watching leaders struggle with the same challenge: how do you navigate uncertainty when the stakes are high?
              </p>
              <p>
                Early in my journey, I learned that innovation isn't just about technologyâ€”it's about people, timing, and understanding what really matters. I've seen brilliant ideas fail because they solved the wrong problem, and simple solutions succeed because they addressed real human needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, I work with leaders who are facing complex decisions. My role isn't to have all the answers, but to help you ask better questions and see patterns that might not be obvious when you're in the middle of it all.
