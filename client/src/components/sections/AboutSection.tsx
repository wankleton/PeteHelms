              <p>
                I believe that great leaders are made in moments of uncertainty. When the path forward isn't clear, when the stakes are high, when conventional wisdom doesn't applyâ€”that's when real leadership emerges.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've been fascinated by these moments my entire career. How do some leaders see opportunities where others see obstacles? How do they make confident decisions with incomplete information? How do they inspire teams to pursue ambitious goals when the outcome is uncertain?
              </p>
              <p>
                This curiosity led me to start companies, study successful leaders, and work alongside teams navigating complex challenges. I discovered that breakthrough results come not from having all the answers, but from asking better questions and seeing patterns that others miss.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, I'm passionate about sharing these insights with leaders who are ready to think differently and act boldly.
